# Scaffold a Godot-Rust Project

This is a small tool that quickly scaffolds a simple boilerplate project for Godot-Rust.

## Installation

### Crates.io

This crate is [hosted on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/scaffold-godot-rust), meaning you can install it with:

```sh
$ cargo install scaffold-godot-rust
```

### From Source

First, clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ByteAtATime/scaffold-godot-rust
$ cd scaffold-godot-rust
```

Then you can build:

```sh
$ cargo build # --release
```

## Usage

You literally just run the built executable and answer the prompts. When you're done, it scaffolds the project automatically.
